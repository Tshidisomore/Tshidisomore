- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tshidisomore – a curious developer starting my journey in tech!
-  👀 I’m passionate about web development and exploring how data can solve real-world problems.
-  🌱 Currently learning HTML, CSS, and Python, building small projects to sharpen my skills.
-  💞️ Looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly open-source projects or team up with others for hackathons – let's create something great together!
-  📫 Reach me on LinkedIn or by email at tshidi@example.com.
-  😄 Pronouns: he/him
-  ⚡ Fun fact: When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me at the gym or trying out new coffee spots ☕️
